![Sign Language](https://github.com/Tharanithirunauvkkarasu/Sign-language/raw/main/sign_language_image.jpg)

## Overview

The **Sign Language Detection Project** leverages **MediaPipe** for hand tracking and recognition, enabling real-time sign language interpretation. By using a single camera and the power of machine learning, this project aims to bridge communication gaps for the hearing-impaired community.

## Features

- **Real-time Hand Tracking**: The system accurately tracks hand gestures using MediaPipe's hand landmarks.
- **Flask Web Application**: The project is built as a Flask web application, making it accessible via a web browser.
- **Customizable Models**: Developers can fine-tune or replace the machine learning model for sign language recognition.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tharanithirunauvkkarasu/Sign-language.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the Web Interface**:

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

- **Upload Video**: Use the web interface to upload a video containing sign language gestures.
- **View Results**: The system will process the video and display recognized sign language gestures.
